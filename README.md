  I build automated, observable, and reproducible network environments.  
  My work spans SONiC/ONIE bring-up, test automation (pytest), CI/CD pipelines,  
  and enabling insights into nightly runs using Grafana + lightweight LLMs.

## What I Work On
- **SONiC lab automation** — ZTP pipelines, ONIE rescue flows, image lifecycle mgmt  
- **Test harnesses** — `pytest` fixtures, SSH abstractions, retries, device CLI helpers  
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions / Jenkins for linting, testing, packaging, releases  
- **Observability** — Grafana dashboards, metrics/log pipelines, nightly test insights  
- **AI tools** — Slack + LangChain experiments for test result summarization

---

## Technical Focus
**Languages:** Python, Bash  
**Networking:** SONiC, BGP, EVPN, VXLAN  
**Infra:** Linux, Docker, Kubernetes  
**Automation:** Ansible, Salt, GitHub Actions  
**Observability:** Grafana, Prometheus, Loki  
**Python stack:** pytest, paramiko, rich, requests

## Featured Projects (Repos Coming Online)
- **sonic-lab-automation** — Declarative ZTP + inventory + image mgmt  
- **pytest-network-harness** — Reusable fixtures & SSH helpers  
- **slack-grafana-langchain** — ChatOps for “Why did nightly fail?”  
- **grafana-llm-notebooks** — LLM-driven nightly test summarizers  
- **kube-fault-injection-playbooks** — Chaos experiments for infra

*(These projects are being published sequentially as cleaned, open-source-safe versions.)*
